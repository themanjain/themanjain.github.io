<h1>Currency and Community - The Social Contract</h1>
<p>Albert Einstein once said "Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe." While these days I wonder what Einstein's frame of reference was as he made this statement, I do know that we as a society stand on the shoulders of giants. Without the foundations laid by figures like Einstein and Hawking, our understanding of the world around us would be fundamentally different. It is through the work of these integral figures that we can discern the world's mysteries and come together to effect change for a better tomorrow, today.<br><br>

With that said, coming together and bringing about change can be unpleasant endeavors. Humans are creatures of habit, and old habits die hard. So I ask this - are you resolved? I know when someone tells me to do something different, one of my most habitual responses is to ask why. Just as water follows the path of least resistance, we often find ourselves working in ways that while may be a solution, may not be the most effective or efficient solution. It is important in times like this to have an open but focused mind.<br><br>

Effective exchange, of course, involves negotiation between many parties. The great sum cannot be reached without exchanging ideas and working on the parts. And so it is vitally important that when one is at the table they thoroughly understand just who they are dealing with and what they are dealing before saying "mazal."</p>
