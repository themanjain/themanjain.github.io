<h1>Currency and Community - The Social Contract</h1>
<p>Albert Einstein once said, <em>“Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I’m not sure about the universe.”</em> While I often wonder what Einstein’s frame of reference was when he made this statement, one thing is certain—we, as a society, stand on the shoulders of giants. Without the foundational work of figures like Einstein and Hawking, our understanding of the world would be vastly different. It is through their groundbreaking contributions that we can decipher the mysteries of our universe and work toward meaningful change.  
<br><br>
That said, bringing about change is rarely easy. Humans are creatures of habit, and old habits die hard. So I ask you—are you truly resolved? When someone suggests a new approach, my instinctive reaction is often to ask <em>why.</em> Just as water follows the path of least resistance, we tend to default to familiar ways of thinking and working. Yet, while our current methods may provide a solution, they may not always be the most effective or efficient. In moments like these, maintaining an open yet focused mind is essential.  
<br><br>
Progress, after all, is built through dialogue and negotiation. The greater sum is achieved by refining the individual parts—by exchanging ideas, challenging assumptions, and understanding both the people and the issues at hand. So before sealing any deal with a confident <em>“mazal,”</em> make sure you fully grasp who and what you’re dealing with.
